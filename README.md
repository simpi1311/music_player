# music_player
This project is a C++ Console-based Music Playlist Manager that enables users to manage their music playlist through various features such as adding, deleting, playing songs, and viewing recently played tracks. The project uses doubly linked lists to store and organize songs and file handling to save and load playlists from a text file.
